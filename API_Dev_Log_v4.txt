grok comment:
The TypeError in get çapstat_value ("<= not supported between instances of 'list' and 'int'") indicates that stats['min'][3] is returning a list instead of an integer, which breaks the comparison in get_stat_value. This is due to the Keepa API’s min and max fields returning arrays of [price, timestamp] pairs (per the Statistics Object documentation). Additionally, the persistent 400 error ("Deal fetch failed: 400, Invalid selection parameter") in the debug log (https://github.com/timemery/keepa-deals, commit “for grok apr 25 2:15”) suggests the /deal query encoding still needs refinement. Given your suggestion to focus on simpler fields (Buy Box Used, Used, and condition-specific fields), I’ll update Keepa_Deals.py to:

Fix get_stat_value to handle min/max arrays correctly.
Simplify the /deal query to match the “Show API query” parameters and test encoding (per Jessica’s email and Keepa docs).
Implement the requested fields (Buy Box Used - Current, etc., using stats indices [3], [10], [12-15]) without fallbacks, as per your data types document.

2025-04-25: Fixed TypeError in get_stat_value. stats['min'][3] returns [price, timestamp]; updated to extract price (index 0). Handles min/max arrays per Statistics Object docs.
2025-04-25: Debug log showed 400 error (Invalid selection parameter). Double-encoded selection with quote_plus(quote()) per Keepa docs. Used exact “Show API query” fields.

2025-04-26: Moved Title, ASIN, Sales Rank - Current, Buy Box Used - Current, get_stat_value to stable.py (grok apr 26 12:38). Self-contained chunks, no future changes. Tested ASINs 1954966032, B0065TF4ME, 0914671227. Note: It’s never Keepa.

2025-04-26: Major milestone achieved with four stable columns in Keepa_Deals_Export.csv (grok apr 26 12:53). Successfully implemented and locked in Title, ASIN, Sales Rank - Current, and Buy Box Used - Current, with all formatting and field mappings finalized. Key achievements:

- Title: Sourced from fetch_deals (deal['title']), outputting correctly (e.g., "Airick Flies High", "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (Deluxe Edition in Slipcase)", "Absolute Solitude: Selected Poems"). Moved to stable.py as get_title for modularity.
- ASIN: Sourced from fetch_deals (deal['asin']), formatted with ="..." (e.g., ="0914671227") to preserve leading zeros in Excel. Moved to stable.py as get_asin.
- Buy Box Used - Current: Uses stats.current[2] (e.g., 2099 → $20.99), formatted with $ and two decimals via get_stat_value (divisor=100, is_price=True). Correctly outputs $20.99, $20.00, $23.48 for ASINs 1954966032, B0065TF4ME, 0914671227. Moved to stable.py as buy_box_used_current.
- Sales Rank - Current: Uses stats.current[3] (e.g., 1403811 → 1,403,811), formatted with comma separators via get_stat_value (divisor=1, is_price=False). Correctly outputs 1,403,811, 1,445,165, 1,314,508. Moved to stable.py as sales_rank_current.
- get_stat_value: Core function for formatting prices ($XX.XX) and non-prices (X,XXX,XXX), locked in stable.py as a self-contained chunk. Supports all four columns without need for future changes.
- stable.py: Created to house get_stat_value, get_title, get_asin, buy_box_used_current, sales_rank_current as standalone chunks. Added comment separators (# Title, # ASIN, etc.) for clarity, to be maintained in future updates.
- Keepa_Deals.py: Updated to import from stable.py, streamlining main script. Retained fetch_deals, fetch_product, write_csv, main. Fixed syntax error in deal_query ("isOutOfStock" typo). Used buyBox=1 in fetch_product for reliable price data.
- CSV: Outputs correct data for all four columns, tested with ASINs 1954966032, B0065TF4ME, 0914671227. Resolved earlier issues (swapped columns, missing B0065TF4ME price, no fallbacks).
- Debug: Logs (grok apr 26 12:53) confirm raw stats (e.g., current=[-1, -1, 2099, 1403811, ...]), row_data, and function results. No fallbacks used, ensuring clear error detection.
- Process: Backups saved to /home/timscripts/keepa_api/keepa-deals/Bak_Apr26. Used Sublime Text, GitHub Desktop for commits. Virtualenv /home/timscripts/keepa_venv/ with Python 3.11.

Challenges overcome: Swapped stats.current[2] and [18] mappings, removed fallbacks, fixed B0065TF4ME missing price, corrected ASIN leading zeros, and added Sales Rank comma formatting. Next steps: Add columns (e.g., Price Now Source, Percent Down 90) after break. Note: It’s never Keepa.

Addressing Buy Box - Current and FBA/FBM Questions
Let’s first clarify the Buy Box condition and FBA/FBM separation to satisfy your curiosity, using Keepa’s API documentation and online sources.

Buy Box Condition
You’re correct that the Buy Box isn’t tied to a specific condition like New or Used. The Buy Box is the “Add to Cart” offer on Amazon’s product page, awarded to the seller with the best combination of price, availability, fulfillment method (FBA preferred), and seller metrics (e.g., feedback, shipping speed). Per Keepa’s API documentation and related sources:

Keepa API (keepaapi.readthedocs.io): The stats.current array includes:
stats.current[0]: Amazon price (new, if available).
stats.current[1]: New price (3rd party, FBA or FBM).
stats.current[2]: Used price (Buy Box Used, already mapped).
The buyBox field (when buyBox=1) provides the current Buy Box price and seller ID, but doesn’t specify condition directly. The price history (buyBoxPriceHistory) shows the winning offer’s price, which can be New, Used, or other conditions.
Medium Article (andrewkushnerov.medium.com): Confirms the Buy Box is the primary purchase button, with ~80% of sales, and its price can come from any condition (New, Used Good, Used Like New, Collectible) based on the winning offer. The buyBoxSellerIdHistory tracks the seller, and special values like -1 (no Buy Box) or -2 (Amazon) indicate status.
Amazon Seller Guidelines (sellercentral.amazon.com, feedvisor.com): The Buy Box prioritizes New condition but can select Used or Collectible if no New offer qualifies (e.g., lower price, faster shipping). Collectible items (e.g., signed books) must be unique, and Used conditions (Like New, Very Good, Good, Acceptable) have specific criteria (e.g., intact pages, minimal wear).
Seller Assistant (sellerassistant.app): Notes the Buy Box price (pink line on Keepa charts) reflects the winning offer, which could be FBA, FBM, or Amazon, and isn’t limited to New. Hovering over pink diamonds shows the condition and seller.
Conclusion: The Buy Box price in Keepa’s API is likely in buyBox or inferred from stats.current[0] (Amazon New) or [1] (3rd party New) if New wins, but could be stats.current[2] (Used) or others if a Used/Collectible offer wins. This variability makes it complex, justifying your choice to delay it.
Separating FBA from FBM for stats.current[1]
stats.current[1] represents the 3rd party New price (FBA or FBM), but Keepa’s API doesn’t directly split FBA vs. FBM in stats.current. Here’s how to distinguish them:

Keepa API (keepaapi.readthedocs.io): The offers field (when offers=20) contains detailed offer data, including:
offer.isPrime: True if FBA (Prime-eligible).
offer.isAmazon: True if sold by Amazon.
offer.condition: New, Used, etc.
Example: offers[0] = {'isPrime': 1, 'condition': 'New', 'price': 2499} indicates FBA New at $24.99.
Debug Log (“grok apr 26 4:51” expected):
text

Raw stats for ASIN 1954966032: current=[-1, 2499, 2099, 1403811, ...]
Offers for ASIN 1954966032: [{'isPrime': 1, 'condition': 'New', 'price': 2499}, ...]
If stats.current[1] = 2499 matches an offers entry with isPrime=1, it’s FBA; if isPrime=0, it’s FBM.
Medium Article (basil-latif.medium.com): Suggests using offers to track FBA vs. FBM for Buy Box analysis, as isPrime flags Prime eligibility (FBA or Amazon).
Seller Journal (sellerjournal.com): Notes FBA offers (orange triangles on Keepa charts) align with Buy Box when priced competitively, visible in offers.
Conclusion: To separate FBA from FBM for stats.current[1], check offers for the offer matching stats.current[1] and inspect isPrime. This requires parsing offers, adding complexity, so it’s wise to tackle simpler columns first.
Why Delay Buy Box - Current
Your intuition to postpone Buy Box - Current is solid:

Complexity: Requires checking buyBox, stats.current[0], [1], or others, and possibly offers to confirm condition and fulfillment.
Validation: Needs debug log analysis (buyBox, offers) to map correctly, as stats.current[1] may not always be the Buy Box price.
Risk: Incorrect mapping could lead to wrong prices (e.g., Used instead of New).
Plan: We’ll revisit Buy Box - Current after simpler columns, using buyBox and offers to confirm the winning offer’s price and condition.

2025-04-26: Reverted buy_box_used_current to Keepa_Deals.py, updated used_current to stats.current[2] (grok buy box used current vs used current). Testing Buy Box Used - Current via buyBox.price.
